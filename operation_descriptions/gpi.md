The `gpi` event reports a change in the state of a general-purpose input (GPI) pin.

This event includes:

- The GPI pin number
- The new pin state (HIGH/LOW)

Use this event to:

- React to external sensors wired to GPI pins (motion, beam-break, button)
- Trigger workflows when an input changes
- Audit input transitions over time
